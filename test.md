### Important
⇤This paper has beneﬁted from comments by Hans Noel, participants at Georgetown Uni- versity’s Political Economy Workshop, and the 2013 Midwest Political Science Association Meetings.[@smith2023]


### Definitions
along a single dimension from 1946-2012. We use resolutions that were identical across years to serve as bridge observations to help make the preference estimates comparable over time. The resulting estimates consistently capture the position of states vis-a-vis a U.S.-led liberal order. During the Cold War, this was the East-West conﬂict between communist and capitalist states. Since the end of the Cold War, the non-Western pole has been occupied by a motley crew of states that have little ideological cohesion other than their opposition to the Western liberal order.[@smith2023]

Estimating Dynamic State Preferences from United Nations Voting Data⇤[@smith2023]

We ﬁrst discuss how UN votes have been used in the literature. We then explain our estimation method and data. The following section evaluates the validity of our estimates.[@smith2023]

### Follow-up
UN General Assembly votes have become the standard data source for measures of states preferences over foreign policy. Most papers use dyadic indicators of voting similarity between states. We propose a dynamic ordinal spatial model to estimate state ideal points from 1946-2012 on a single dimension that reﬂects state positions towards the U.S. led liberal order. We use information about the content of the UN’s agenda to make estimates comparable across time. Compared to existing measures, our estimates better separate signal from noise in identifying foreign policy shifts, have greater face validity, allow for better inter-temporal comparisons, are less sensitive to shifts in the UN’s agenda, and are strongly correlated with measures of liberalism. We show that the choice of preference measures a↵ects conclusions about the democratic peace.[@smith2023]

Second, our estimates are better able to distinguish signal from noise in identifying mean- ingful shifts in foreign policy orientations. For example, ideal points analysis of our ideal point estimates consistently indicates that left-wing regimes in Latin America were system- atically less favorable to the U.S. than right-wing regimes. We do not ﬁnd this pattern with S-scores.[@smith2023]

Others have used UN-based measures as dependent variables to ascertain whether social- ization through IGOs leads to convergence in member state interests (Bearce and Bondanella, 2007), whether leadership and regime changes alter foreign policy orientations (Dreher and Jensen, 2013), whether the EU has started to form a cohesive foreign policy (Drieskens, 2010), whether the U.S. is becoming increasingly isolated on foreign policy issues (Voeten, 2004),[@smith2023]
